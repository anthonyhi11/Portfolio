          The goal of this application is to have a user be tested on their
          knowledge of my favorite band, Bon Iver. As the user progresses
          through the quiz, they are presented with a question and 4 options.
          <img src="Images/options-quiz.png" class="images" />
          Once an option is selected and submitted, they are shown if they are
          correct or incorrect. If incorrect, they can show the correct answer
          or continue on to the next question.
          <img src="Images/incorrect-quiz.png" class="images" />
          The score is tallied up at the end and they are shown either a
          congratulations screen or a try again screen depending on the score.
          The user can then take the quiz again, if they choose.
